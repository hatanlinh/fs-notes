# fs-notes
A simple note-taking app built for my personal use

## TODO
- Upgrade deprecated dependency @types/gapi.client.drive.
- Fix typescript warnings.
- Theming.
- Handle tabs of disconnected storage (maybe close them?).
- Template name for new file.
- Allow creating file inside directory.
- Review vibe-coded slops to verify logics :)))
